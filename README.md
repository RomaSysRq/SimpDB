# SimpDB
A demo of some sort of social media and mail.

## If you want to use this program with internet:

1. Create shared folder
2. Move db.db file there
3. Edit sourcecode.py:
   11: db = pickledb.load('*your shared folder/db.db*', True)
4. Send the sourcecode or compiled program to people you want to talk to.
5. If you are not connected by LAN, use Radmin VPN or other program like that.
6. Make sure others can see your folder.
7. Done.

This program is not protected by anything at all.
Everything you do will be located in db.db file in shared folder.
